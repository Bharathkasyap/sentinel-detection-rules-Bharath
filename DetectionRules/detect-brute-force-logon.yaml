# ==========================
# üß† Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# Brute force attacks involve automated login attempts using common or leaked passwords.
# Attackers often target services like RDP, SMB, VPN, or OWA.
# If successful, the attack transitions into credential theft, lateral movement, or privilege escalation.
#
# üîç What Attackers Might Do Post-Detection:
# - Logon success (EventID 4624) after failures
# - Lateral movement via RDP, SMB, WinRM (T1021)
# - Credential theft from LSASS (T1003)
# - Data exfiltration from local systems (T1005)
# - Use harvested credentials for privilege escalation (T1078)
# - Abuse access to email (T1114)
#
# üìÇ Log Tables to Review:
# - SecurityEvent (4625 and 4624)
# - DeviceLogonEvents (track lateral movement)
# - SigninLogs (especially for cloud environments)
# - DeviceProcessEvents (script execution post-login)
# - DeviceFileEvents (file access/downloads)
# - RegistryEvents (persistence setup)
# - EmailEvents, OfficeActivity (suspicious mailbox activity)
#
# üîÅ Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Confirm if 4624 follows the 4625 burst
# 2. Check where the successful account was used next (DeviceLogonEvents)
# 3. Look for credential theft attempts (lsass, procdump, comsvcs)
# 4. Explore lateral logins to other systems
# 5. Monitor file and email access patterns
#
# üõ°Ô∏è Response Actions:
# - Disable/suspend the account
# - Reset password, enforce MFA
# - Review GPO or RBAC for the user
# - Audit login attempts across the domain
# - Check endpoint health and isolation if needed
