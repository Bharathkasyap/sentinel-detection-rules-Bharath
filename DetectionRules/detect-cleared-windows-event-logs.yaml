# ==========================
# 🧠 Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# 📘 Context:
# EventID 1102 = “The audit log was cleared.” Almost always a red flag unless part of scheduled log rotation.
#
# 🔍 What Attackers Might Do:
# - Clear logs after privilege escalation or data theft
# - Use audit clearing to hide lateral movement and persistence
#
# 📂 Log Tables to Review:
# - SecurityEvent 1102 (log cleared)
# - Event 4688 (process creation)
# - RegistryEvents (check persistence remnants)
#
# 🔁 Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Review who cleared the log and when
# 2. Check if attack traces exist before clearing
# 3. Audit full event log history for gaps
#
# 🛡️ Response Actions:
# - Alert SOC and isolate the host
# - Review logs from SIEM, Sysmon, or endpoint sensors
# - Notify IR team and preserve memory/image
