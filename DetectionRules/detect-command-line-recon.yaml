# ==========================
# 🧠 Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# 📘 Context:
# Attackers commonly execute commands like `whoami`, `ipconfig`, and `net user` to learn about system roles, accounts, and network info.
#
# 🔍 What Attackers Might Do:
# - Determine user privileges
# - Identify domain membership and roles
# - Pivot to lateral movement targets
#
# 📂 Log Tables to Review:
# - DeviceProcessEvents (grouped by command context)
# - DeviceLogonEvents (verify who ran the recon)
# - DeviceNetworkEvents (network reconnaissance via netstat)
#
# 🔁 Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Confirm the commands are not part of a script/tool
# 2. Review user behavior pre/post recon
# 3. Pivot to check lateral movement or SMB access after recon
#
# 🛡️ Response Actions:
# - Alert security team to investigate session
# - Isolate device if script/tool abuse is confirmed
# - Harden account permissions and monitor further behavior
