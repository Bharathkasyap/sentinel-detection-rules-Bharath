# ==========================
# 🧠 Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# 📘 Context:
# Forwarding rules silently redirect internal or sensitive emails to external inboxes, often used in BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks.
#
# 🔍 What Attackers Might Do:
# - Forward finance, HR, or executive email to attacker-controlled domains
# - Hide rule with names like “Fax” or “AdminOps”
#
# 📂 Log Tables to Review:
# - EmailEvents (inbox rule creation/modification)
# - OfficeActivity (PowerShell run via ExchangeOnline)
# - SigninLogs (unusual login to mailbox)
#
# 🔁 Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Verify who created the rule and from where
# 2. Check if multiple mailboxes have similar rules
# 3. Pivot to browser sign-ins and MFA bypasses
#
# 🛡️ Response Actions:
# - Remove rule and disable mailbox access
# - Force sign-out and password reset
# - Alert finance/HR for potential data exposure
# - Restrict external forwarding org-wide
