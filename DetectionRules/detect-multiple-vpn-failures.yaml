# ==========================
# 🧠 Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# 📘 Context:
# VPN is often targeted in external access attacks. Brute force against VPN shows up as failed auth events on Entra ID/Azure SigninLogs or NPS logs.
#
# 🔍 What Attackers Might Do:
# - Use sprayed passwords to log in
# - Try multiple users from one IP (or vice versa)
#
# 📂 Log Tables to Review:
# - SigninLogs (VPN app sign-in failures)
# - AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs
# - SecurityEvent (local RADIUS auth failures)
#
# 🔁 Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Check if failures come from known IP range
# 2. Search if any eventual success follows the failures
# 3. Look for use of those credentials elsewhere
#
# 🛡️ Response Actions:
# - Block external IP if persistent
# - Alert user and reset credentials
# - Enable lockout policy on VPN endpoint
# - Require MFA for all VPN-accessible accounts
