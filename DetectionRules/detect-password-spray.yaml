# ==========================
# 🧠 Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# 📘 Context:
# Password spraying involves trying one or two passwords across many accounts to avoid lockouts.
#
# 🔍 What Attackers Might Do:
# - Gain access to low-privilege accounts for recon
# - Use successful account for phishing or lateral movement
#
# 📂 Log Tables to Review:
# - SecurityEvent 4625 (source of spray)
# - SigninLogs (for external spray via Azure/Entra ID)
# - DeviceProcessEvents (post-access activity)
#
# 🔁 Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Identify the spraying IP across the enterprise
# 2. Check if any accounts from the spray list had later success
# 3. Monitor behavior of suspected accounts
#
# 🛡️ Response Actions:
# - Block IP at firewall or endpoint
# - Force password reset for all targeted accounts
# - Enable MFA for all critical users
# - Set lockout policies on authentication attempts
