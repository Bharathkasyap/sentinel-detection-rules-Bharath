# ==========================
# 🧠 Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# 📘 Context:
# PsExec is a common tool for executing commands on remote machines. Used by attackers, pentesters, and system admins.
#
# 🔍 What Attackers Might Do:
# - Deploy ransomware across the domain
# - Remotely install software/payloads
# - Move laterally post-access
#
# 📂 Log Tables to Review:
# - DeviceProcessEvents (psexec.exe, process chains)
# - DeviceNetworkEvents (connections to admin shares)
# - DeviceFileEvents (remote payload write)
#
# 🔁 Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Confirm whether usage is approved/admin or malicious
# 2. Check parent process and user session
# 3. Correlate with service installation or user creation
#
# 🛡️ Response Actions:
# - Alert SOC for manual triage
# - Disable PsExec if not used legitimately
# - Isolate endpoint and check for lateral access
