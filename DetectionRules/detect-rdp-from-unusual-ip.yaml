# ==========================
# üß† Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# RDP is a popular protocol for remote administration but often abused post-compromise.
# Sudden RDP from new countries/IPs may indicate credential theft or session hijacking.
#
# üîç What Attackers Might Do Post-RDP:
# - Drop malware manually (Cobalt Strike, ransomware)
# - Modify system policies or disable security tools
# - Create new users or escalate privileges
# - Dump memory (lsass)
# - Move laterally to pivot hosts
#
# üìÇ Log Tables to Review:
# - SecurityEvent (4624, LogonType = 10)
# - DeviceNetworkEvents (connections to C2 or staging hosts)
# - DeviceProcessEvents (post-login activity)
# - RegistryEvents (evidence of persistence)
# - DeviceFileEvents (malware drops, tool usage)
# - AADSignInLogs / SigninLogs (if hybrid identity)
#
# üîÅ Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Confirm geolocation/IP is not part of known org traffic
# 2. Identify unusual patterns in remote logins (e.g., RDP off-hours)
# 3. Correlate with any recent password reset or phishing alerts
# 4. Monitor for malicious tools (psexec, mimikatz, ntdsutil)
# 5. Look for changes in local group membership
#
# üõ°Ô∏è Response Actions:
# - Temporarily block inbound RDP
# - Force password rotation for the account
# - Alert on future RDP from this host/IP combo
# - Enable Just-In-Time access for privileged RDP users
# - Review GPO firewall settings and logon audit policy
