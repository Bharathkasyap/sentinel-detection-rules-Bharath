# ==========================
# 🧠 Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# 📘 Context:
# Scheduled tasks are often used by threat actors to maintain persistence or to schedule recurring command/script execution.
#
# 🔍 What Attackers Might Do:
# - Set scheduled execution of PowerShell or batch scripts
# - Trigger malware payload on reboot or interval
# - Maintain long-term access without re-exploitation
#
# 📂 Log Tables to Review:
# - DeviceProcessEvents (confirm schtasks command origin)
# - RegistryEvents (check for persistence keys)
# - SecurityEvent 4698 (new task creation)
# - DeviceFileEvents (check dropped payloads or scripts)
#
# 🔁 Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Analyze task name and frequency in command line
# 2. Check what payload or script is being launched
# 3. Identify parent process → was it spawned by malware?
# 4. Look for similar tasks created on other endpoints
#
# 🛡️ Response Actions:
# - Review and delete unauthorized tasks
# - Disable schtasks.exe via AppLocker if not needed
# - Audit startup folders and run keys
# - Block execution of suspicious scripts used in the task
