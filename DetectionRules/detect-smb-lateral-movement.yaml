# ==========================
# üß† Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# üìò Context:
# SMB is used to connect to shared folders. Lateral movement using `psexec`, `wmic`, or `copy` over `ADMIN$` is common post-compromise behavior.
#
# üîç What Attackers Might Do:
# - Copy and execute malware remotely
# - Harvest credentials from peer systems
# - Escalate privileges by jumping to domain controller
#
# üìÇ Log Tables to Review:
# - DeviceNetworkEvents (445 traffic from admin tools)
# - DeviceProcessEvents (check what launched the traffic)
# - SecurityEvent 4624 (logon to remote machine)
#
# üîÅ Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Validate if tool use (like psexec) is legitimate
# 2. Trace command-line arguments for malicious scripts or DLLs
# 3. Review if session led to service install or task creation
#
# üõ°Ô∏è Response Actions:
# - Block IP-to-IP access on port 445 if unnecessary
# - Restrict admin rights through segmentation
# - Investigate remote machines targeted
