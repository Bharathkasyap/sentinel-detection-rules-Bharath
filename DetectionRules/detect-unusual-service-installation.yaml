# ==========================
# 🧠 Analyst Knowledge
# ==========================
# 📘 Context:
# Attackers and red teams often register malicious services that execute payloads or scripts during startup or login.
#
# 🔍 What Attackers Might Do:
# - Launch malware payload persistently
# - Gain SYSTEM-level access
# - Trigger malicious tasks without user interaction
#
# 📂 Log Tables to Review:
# - SecurityEvent 7045 (service install)
# - DeviceProcessEvents (if service installer was a script/tool)
# - RegistryEvents (check autoruns or startup keys)
#
# 🔁 Threat Hunting Flow:
# 1. Check `ServiceFileName` for known bad paths (temp, public folders)
# 2. Validate if service is in known whitelist
# 3. Confirm signing/certificate and origin
#
# 🛡️ Response Actions:
# - Disable and remove the service
# - Review associated files and memory dumps
# - Audit similar installations across fleet
